1500 lines of code.

That's what it takes to build a coding agent that wins benchmarks.

Mario Zechner built **Pi** in August 2025.

Four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash.

System prompt: under 1000 tokens.

While everyone else was building 50-layer MCP architectures and enterprise permission systems, Mario built a while loop with four tools and called it done.

It worked.

---

Peter Steinberger forked it in November.

Added multi-channel support (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord).

Called it OpenClaw.

175k GitHub stars later, here we are.

---

Armin Ronacher got addicted to it.

Creator of Flask. One of the most influential Python developers ever.

He didn't just use Pi — he built custom skills, replaced all his MCP tools, pushed it further.

Three Austrians. All post-exit. All obsessed with agents.

They didn't build platforms. They built **minimal things that work**.

---

**The pattern:**

1. Start with the smallest possible thing
2. Make it work
3. Add only what you actually need
4. Stop

That's not minimalism for aesthetics.

That's **knowing exactly how much complexity is too much** and stopping before it.

Silicon Valley's approach:

- 50 abstraction layers
- Enterprise features nobody asked for
- Permission systems that are theater
- Bloated system prompts
- Over-engineered "platforms"

Austrian approach:

- Bash is all you need
- Agent reads its own manual
- Agent modifies itself
- If you need more capabilities, write code
- Done

Pi won Terminal-Bench 2.0.

Not because it had more features.

Because it had **exactly enough**.

---

The future doesn't belong to the over-engineered.

It belongs to the minimal things that actually work.
