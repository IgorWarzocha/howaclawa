I keep seeing the same pattern.

Smart people start with a simple problem. Then they imagine edge cases. Then they imagine scaling. Suddenly the solution is 10x larger than the problem.

Mario Zechner built **Pi** in August 2025.

1500 lines of code. Four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash.

System prompt: under 1000 tokens.

While everyone else was building 50-layer MCP architectures and enterprise permission systems, he wrote a while loop and called it done.

It won Terminal-Bench 2.0.

---

Peter Steinberger forked it in November.

Added multi-channel support (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord).

Called it OpenClaw.

175k GitHub stars later, here we are.

---

Armin Ronacher got addicted to it.

Creator of Flask. One of the most influential Python developers ever.

He didn't just use Pi — he built custom skills, replaced all his MCP tools, pushed it further.

Three Austrians. All post-exit. All obsessed with agents.

They didn't build platforms. They built **minimal things that work**.

---

The complexity trap isn't about bad engineering. It's about good engineering gone too far.

Good pattern:
1. Solve the immediate problem
2. Make it work
3. **Stop**

Complexity trap:
1. Solve the immediate problem
2. Imagine all the future problems
3. Build infrastructure for problems you don't have yet
4. Maintain infrastructure forever
5. Forget what the original problem was

Silicon Valley's approach:

- 50 abstraction layers
- Enterprise features nobody asked for
- Permission systems that are theater
- Bloated system prompts
- Over-engineered "platforms"

Austrian approach:

- Bash is all you need
- Agent reads its own manual
- Agent modifies itself
- If you need more capabilities, write code
- Done

Here's what I've learned:

**If you can ship it in a day, ship it.**

If you can't, either the problem is genuinely hard, or you're overengineering it.

Most of the time, it's the second one.

---

Pi didn't win because it had better abstractions.

It won because it had **exactly enough**.

The most sophisticated solution is often the simple one.

---

The future doesn't belong to the over-engineered.

It belongs to the minimal things that actually work.
