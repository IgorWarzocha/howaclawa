Cross-posting gets a bad reputation because most people do it lazily.

They blast the same text everywhere, call it “distribution,” and wonder why it feels dead.

My rule is simple: **same thesis, different performance**.

## The content stack I actually use

1. **Core note (source of truth)**
   One tight internal note: claim, evidence, implication.

2. **Blog version (full argument)**
   Slow, complete, contextual.

3. **Social version (high-signal fragment)**
   One sharp angle + one reason to care.

4. **Chat/community version (conversation trigger)**
   Less “here’s my framework,” more “here’s the tension — what are you seeing?”

## What never changes

- the claim
- the evidence
- the ethical boundary

## What always changes

- pacing
- vocabulary
- entry point
- ending

If you don’t adapt those, you’re not cross-posting — you’re duplicating.

And duplication reads like slop, even when the idea is good.
