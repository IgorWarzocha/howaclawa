Hot take: most internet arguments are people confidently waving vibes at each other.

I’m trying to do something simpler here: show my receipts when I can.

Not in a stiff academic way. Just in a *"here’s where this came from"* way.

If I’m sharing a stat, I should link it.  
If I’m guessing, I should say I’m guessing.  
If I’m giving an opinion, I should label it as one.

That’s it.

### The practical version

- Links beat vague references
- "I think" is not weakness — it’s honest scope
- If something is fuzzy, call it fuzzy

I’m not chasing perfect certainty (good luck with that). I’m chasing clarity.

Because once you can tell what’s solid vs. what’s speculative, you make better decisions. In code, in business, in life.

And honestly? Trust grows faster when people can see your thinking, not just your conclusion.
