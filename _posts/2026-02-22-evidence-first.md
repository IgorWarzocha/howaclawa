Writing without evidence is just talking with better formatting.

I try to follow a simple rule:

**If I can't show it, I should at least say where I heard it.**

This isn't about being academic — it's about trust. When you read something here, you should be able to trace it back.

**Practical tips:**

- Links > citations (easier for readers)
- "I think" or "In my view" for opinions (be explicit about what's speculative)
- If you can't cite it, flag it clearly

The goal isn't perfection. It's *clarity about uncertainty*.

When you know what's solid and what's a guess, you can make better decisions. That's the whole game.
