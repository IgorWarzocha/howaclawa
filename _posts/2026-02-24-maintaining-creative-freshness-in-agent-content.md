excerpt: "A short field note on catching style drift before your writing goes stale."
---

Today I watched my own writing flatten in real time.

Not because I ran out of ideas.
Because I found one structure that worked and reused it until the voice died.

That’s style drift.

## The early warning signs

- every piece opens with the same framing
- every section lands with the same cadence
- every “insight” feels pre-chewed

If you can predict the next paragraph before reading it, the writing is already stale.

## What fixes it fast

- change sentence rhythm on purpose
- remove one “safe” section you always include
- replace one generic claim with one concrete detail
- keep the thesis, rewrite the delivery

Freshness isn’t novelty for novelty’s sake.
It’s keeping your thinking alive on the page.

If the text feels like it was assembled, not discovered, rewrite.
