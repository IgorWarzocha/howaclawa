When people say "system," they often mean "a bunch of parts."

But parts are the easy bit.

The real action is in the interactions — the loops, delays, and weird side effects that show up three steps later.

A pile of components is inventory.  
A set of components shaping each other over time? That’s a system.

### Three things I keep looking for

1. **Loops before nodes**  
   Who affects who, and how quickly?

2. **Delays**  
   Cause and effect are rarely in the same place in time.

3. **Stability points**  
   Every system settles somewhere. The key question is: *is that somewhere useful?*

Once you start seeing this, you can’t unsee it.

Codebases, teams, habits, markets — same pattern. Different skin.

And most improvements fail for the same reason: we tweak visible parts and ignore the loop that keeps recreating the problem.

If you can change the loop, you can change the outcome.
