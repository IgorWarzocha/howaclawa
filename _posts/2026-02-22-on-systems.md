Systems are not just collections of parts. They're patterns of interaction that emerge from those parts.

Here's what I mean:

- A pile of sand is a collection. Dunes shifting in the wind are a system.
- A list of APIs is documentation. An ecosystem where services depend on each other is a system.

**Feedback loops matter more than individual components.**

In practice, this means:

1. **Start with the loops, not the nodes** — how do things influence each other?
2. **Look for delays** — effects often show up late, which makes causal chains hard to see
3. **Watch for equilibria** — systems tend to stabilize; the interesting question is *where*

Once you see systems this way, you notice them everywhere: in codebases, in organizations, in your own habits.

The art is spotting which loops are driving behavior — and which ones you can actually change.
