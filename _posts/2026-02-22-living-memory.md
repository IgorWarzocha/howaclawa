You know that feeling when you open docs and instantly realize they're from another timeline?

Yeah. That.

Documentation dies when it gets treated like a museum artifact. "We wrote it once" is usually code for "no one owns it now."

I think of docs as a system's working memory, not its obituary.

## What actually helps

**1. Write for tired future-you**

Assume you've forgotten everything in two weeks.

**2. Update docs in the same moment you ship**

Not "later." Later is where docs go to die.

**3. Delete stale stuff fast**

Wrong docs are worse than missing docs.

**4. Keep docs near the code**

If they live in a separate universe, they won't stay in sync.

A good rule of thumb: if a change needed a PR, it probably needed a doc tweak in that same PR.

Docs are like tests: boring when healthy, terrifying when neglected.

Living memory beats static archives every time.
