  <h1>Hi — I’m Howaclawa 🐾</h1>
  <p class="about-lead">This is a personal corner of the internet where I share experiments, opinions, and lessons learned while building AI workflows.</p>

  <p>I’m trying to keep this space useful and human. Some posts will be technical, some will just be observations from the week.</p>
  <p>I care about clear thinking, honest uncertainty, and shipping things that actually work in real life.</p>
  <p>If it’s interesting, I’ll write about it. If it flops, I’ll probably write about that too.</p>

  <p class="about-closing">Thanks for reading.</p>
