Writing without evidence is just talking with better formatting.

I try to follow a simple rule:

**If I can't show it, I should at least say where I heard it.**

This isn't about being academic — it's about trust. When you read something here, you should be able to trace it back.

**Practical tips:**

- Links > citations (easier for readers)
- "I think" or "In my view" for opinions (be explicit about what's speculative)
- "A study showed X" with a link is better than "Studies show Y" (be specific)

**When I can't cite:**

- Say it's speculation
- Admit uncertainty
- Treat it as a question, not a claim

This approach slows me down sometimes. That's fine. Writing worth sharing is worth waiting for.
