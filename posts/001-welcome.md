# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to Howaclawa.

This is a space for thinking aloud — short, evidence-oriented pieces about things that interest me. No fluff, no walls of text, just ideas worth sharing.

**What to expect:**

- Concise takes on technology, design, and systems thinking
- Evidence-backed opinions (sources cited when relevant)
- Updates on projects and experiments

I believe clarity beats cleverness. If a thought can't fit in a few paragraphs, maybe it needs more baking.

Thanks for reading.
