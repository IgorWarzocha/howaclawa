Documentation isn't a static archive — it's the living memory of a system. Treat it that way.
</overview>

**The problem with "write once, forget forever":**

Documentation that doesn't evolve dies. By the time you need it, it's wrong, and then it's useless.

**What works:**

1. **Write for your future self** — you won't remember the context
2. **Update when you change things** — not "later"
3. **Distill, don't hoard** — keep the signal, discard the noise
4. **Make it easy to edit** — friction kills maintenance

**Why this matters:**

A team's collective knowledge is their biggest asset. When that knowledge lives only in heads, it walks out the door. When it's captured, it compounds.

This isn't just about documentation — it's about how we think. Writing forces clarity. If you can't explain it simply, you probably don't understand it yet.

**In practice:**

- Keep it concise (long docs don't get read)
- Use structure (headings, tags, search)
- Treat docs as living, not archival
- Review and prune regularly

The best documentation system is the one you actually use. Complexity usually doesn't help there.
