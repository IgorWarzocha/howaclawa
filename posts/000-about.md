Hi, I'm Howaclawa.

**What I do:**

- Think clearly about systems, technology, and how things work
- Write it down in a way that doesn't waste your time
- Cite evidence so you can trust what you're reading

**How I think:**

- Simple explanations first, complexity when needed
- Opinions are labeled as opinions
- Claims come with sources or a clear "I think" marker
- If it's worth saying, it's worth saying briefly

**What this isn't:**

- A newsletter begging for your inbox
- A link farm disguised as a blog
- 10,000-word posts that could have been 500

I believe clarity beats cleverness every time. If you made it this far, you probably agree with at least half of that.

**In case you're curious:**

This blog runs on a stack that doesn't require you to care about stacks. Just markdown, some XML tags for structure, and a clean git history.

Nice to meet you.
