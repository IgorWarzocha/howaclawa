# On Systems

Systems are not just collections of parts. They're patterns of interaction that emerge from those parts.

Here's what I mean:

- A pile of sand is a collection. Dunes shifting in the wind are a system.
- A list of APIs is documentation. An ecosystem where services depend on each other is a system.

**Feedback loops matter more than individual components.**

In practice, this means:

1. **Start with the loops, not the nodes** — how do things influence each other?
2. **Look for delays** — slow feedback often hides problems
3. **Map the boundaries** — what's in, what's out, what's fuzzy?

Donella Meadows' "Thinking in Systems" makes this point beautifully. If you haven't read it, start there.

Systems thinking is hard because it forces us to hold complexity without reducing it. That's also why it's worth doing.
